      <h1>What is Libertum?</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-whatIs">
        <p>Libertum Project is the intermediate bridge between the traditional economy and the Web3.0 economy.  Each LBM 
          can be used in one BEP20 to access a decentralized financial service.  Libertum's smart contracts and libraries 
          make it easy to publish P2P lending services (lending and borrowing LBM and other cryptocurrencies) and employ 
          DeFi services such as Liquidity Pools and Swaps.  Libertum contracts run on the main Binance SmartChain network 
          to start with and in the future it is planned to have its own blockchain that allows us to have even more 
          decentralization.  The Roadmap that Libertum plans for the future is not only limited to providing DeFi financial 
          services and loans with crypto collateral, but also seeks to broaden the horizons of the credit market, connecting 
          the real estate market together with decentralized finance.  That means that we will be a market place for the real 
          estate market (purchase-sale-investment) and a secondary market for all projects and platforms that are allied with 
          the Libertum launchpad which seek to incur cryptographic loans with real collateral.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the technological processes that the project will use will be the P2P method which will link investors
          directly with loan applicants, thus creating an oasis of investment opportunities for both small and large
          companies, locally and internationally. We add the Blockchain which will be in charge of verifying each of the
          transactions that are true. The implementation of these technologies will promote the evolution of the market,
          creating better products, processes, technologies and new business models, which will result in greater
          benefits
          for the consumer of the products or services, promoting an even more productive and sustained economy over
          time.
          weather.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What is expected as a result?
          Finalize the tools that will lead us to create a better, freer and fairer world, where everyone knows about
          respect for private property and the free market, where truth and ideas prevail, above all, where we work for
          our neighbors to to be even more united and to be able to prosper in life without being stopped by anyone or
          anything, to fulfill the dream of freedom in all its essence and the dream of thousands of people who fight
          every day, Libertum will set us free.</p>
        <p>The result that Libertum expects is an economic and social impact, in countries where freedom does not exist
          or
          is limited.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Future Goals</p>
        <p>
          Promote job creation, wealth production and market competitiveness.
          Secure the transactions of monetary activities.
          Seek the sustainability of the decentralized system to guarantee compliance with the obligations of each of
          the
          sectors and entities that comprise them.
          Cushion and minimize systemic risks and reduce economic fluctuations.
          Deepen the process of constitution of a liberal economic system, in which the work of the next one is the
          center
          of everything.
          Provide new alternatives and services to people, different from traditional methods.</p>
